How do I compile the DirectX samples with Borland C++?

It is a little bit tricky to get a DirectX sample to compile with Borland C++. Here's what ya got to do:

Create a new project, be sure to select Win32 as the target platform

Create new .lib's. At the command prompt type something like this:
>implib ddraw.lib ddraw.dll

You have to do this, because the ones that come with the DirectX sdk are for Visual C++.

Add your new lib and c files to the project.

At the very top of your .c file, before you include ddraw.h toss these couple of lines in:
#if defined( __BORLANDC__ ) && defined( __WIN32__ )
#define _WIN32
#endif

The reason for this one is because Borland and Microsoft use slightly different defines for __WIN32__ 
And here is a Borland C++ 4.52 project for DDEX1: bcddex1.zip
