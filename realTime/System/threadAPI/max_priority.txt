Thread.MAX_PRIORITY
---------------------------------
public static final int MAX_PRIORITY

The highest thread scheduling priority that 
can be passed to setPriority()for a particular 
VM. Generally, it is 10 for an application and 6 
for an applet. Threads running at this level might 
hog the processor and should be designed to block 
frequently to give other threads a chance to run.
