IMPLEMENT RUNNABLE INTERFACE


When we want to create a collection of closely related classes that share some behaviours, then we should 
use inheritance. If classes are not closely related then inheritance should not be used. The other option is to 
implement a runnable interface. Since Java does not allow multiple inheritance there are occasions when 
using an interface is the only possible strategy. 

Advantages:

* A class can both extend a superclass and implement one or more interfaces
* Implementing an interface does not imply any close relationship between classes, unlike inheritance

To write an interface class you use the keyword 'interface' instead of 'class', and the methods have no 
definition.
