Method based synchronization

Information hiding is at the heart of object oriented programming. An object should use class 
methods to get and set data. If a thread can only gain access to data through class methods, then 
the data can be indirectly protected through the method. Methods can be protected by preceding 
the method name with the keyword synchronized.

The bank account example could synchronize method deposit(), allowing only one thread access 
at a time.

Synchronized void deposit(int amount, String name) {

Result:
#1  trying to deposit 1000
#1  getting balance...
#1  balance got is 1000
#1  setting balance...
#1  new balance set to 2000
					#2  trying to deposit 1000
					#2  getting balance...
					#2  balance got is 2000
					#2  setting balance...
					#2  new balance set to 3000

Only one thread can access method deposit at any one time preventing data corruption.
