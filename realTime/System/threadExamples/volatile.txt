volatile

The keyword volatile is used to prevent threads picking up the wrong information. Volatile
forces the thread to reread the variable's value from shared memory every time it is 
accessed. Likewise, a thread also is forced to change the variables value as soon as it 
happens.

No private copies of a variable should be used, and interaction should be directly with the 
shared copy. 


private volatile int value;
