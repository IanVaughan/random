Missed Notification

notify() is used to notify a waiting thread that it can proceed. Look at the following example.


threadA notifies threadB that it can proceed

threadB is not waiting for the notification


threadB in this example has totally missed the notification. A boolean variable is used to 
overcome this problem.


private Object proceedLock;
private boolean okToProceed;

public void waitToProceed() throws InterruptedException
{
	synchronized ( proceedLock)
	{
		while ( okToProceed == false )
		{
			proceedLock.wait();
		}
	}
}

public void proceed()
{
	synchronized ( proceedLock )
	{
		okToProceed = true;
		proceedLock.notifyAll();
	}
}
