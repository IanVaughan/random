isInterrupted

This does not alter the status of the thread. It returns true if the thread has been interrupted, and
otherwise returns false.

public static void main(String[ ] args)
{

	Thread t = new Thread();

	System.out.println("Point A : interrupted = " + t.isInterrupted() );
		
	//interrupt thread
	t.interrupt();

	System.out.println("Point B : interrupted = " + t.isInterrupted() );

		
	//pause for a bit
	try
	{
		//delays for 2000 milliseconds
		Thread.sleep(2000);

		System.out.println("was not interrupted");
	}
	catch(InterruptedException x)
	{
		System.out.println("was interrupted");
	}

	System.out.println("Point C : interrupted = " + t.isInterrupted() );

}

Result

Point A : interrupted = false		
Point B : interrupted = true		-thread has been interrupted
was interrupted			-try block throws an exception as thread is interrupted
Point C : interrupted = false		-interrupted flag was cleared by sleep()
