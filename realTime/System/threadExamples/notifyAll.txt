notifyAll()

It's fuctionality is very similar to notify(), but it notifies all threads waiting on the changed
object. 


The advantage 

You do not need to know which threads to notify as they are all notified.


The disadvantage

Could be a waste in processor time informing lots of threads when only one need be 
informed.
