Inter-thread communication

When you have several threads running within an application, communication is very 
important. Using synchronization, only one thread can change data at any one time. 
But how will other threads know that data has been changed? Inter thread signalling
is needed. There are several ways of achieving communication amongst threads.


The Busy / Wait  method

while ( getValue() != desiredValue)
{
	Thread.sleep(100);
}


In the above example there is a continuous search for the current value. The drawback 
is that a continuous search is using up processor time. The a;ternative is to make the 
thread sleep longer. This will reduce processor time but may take longer to inform other
threads of any changes.
